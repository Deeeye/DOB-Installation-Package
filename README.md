## **Overview**
The **DevOps-Bot** is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) automation tool designed to streamline the management of cloud resources, configuration management, and orchestration of services across multiple cloud providers.

It combines the capabilities of **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and **Ansible** for configuration management, providing a unified interface for managing DevOps workflows.

---

## **Features**
- **Multi-cloud support**: Manage resources on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- **Infrastructure provisioning**: Create and manage VPCs, EC2 instances, Kubernetes clusters, and more.
- **Configuration management**: Automate server configuration and application deployment.
- **State management**: Track and update infrastructure state similar to Terraform.
- **Scriptable workflows**: Use YAML files to define and execute tasks.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Operating System: Linux or macOS (Windows support coming soon)
